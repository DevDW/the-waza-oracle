# The Waza Oracle

Based on your choice of a position and technique complexity, the web app returns a randomly-selected YouTube technique video from a curated library.

### Background
Built in April and May 2018, The Waza Oracle was my first independent project that I completed after beginning my journey to learn how to program in spring 2018. As an avid BJJ practitioner, I wanted to build a project that merged some of my interests.
